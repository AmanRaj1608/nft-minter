   "description": "Rohit Sharma had become the 3rd Indian cricketer after Sahin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag to hit a double hundred as early as 2013. Rohit Sharma went on to do the unthinkable as he became the only batsmen to post a 250-plus score in ODI cricket. Rohit Sharma hit 264, the highest-ever ODI total against Sri Lanka, smashing 33 boundaries and 9 sixes. Rohit started slow but accelerated in his inimitable style after getting to the 100. Despite taking 100 balls to get to his hundred, Rohit raced to 264 in just 173 balls, scoring the last 164 runs in just 73 balls.",
